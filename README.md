# Shiny-App-LA-Employee-Payroll

This project visualizes payroll information of LA city employees in years 2013-2018 through an interactive R Shiny app. The original data is available at https://controllerdata.lacity.org/Payroll/City-Employee-Payroll/pazn-qyym. The dashboard explores what government departments earn the most and cost the most to run, which jobs earn the most, top earning individuals, and other breakouts. Users can select analysis by year, how many rows to display, and type of analysis to perform (mean or median).
